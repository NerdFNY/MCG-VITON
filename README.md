![](https://github.com/NerdFNY/MCG-VITON/raw/master/fig.png)  
This is the official implementation of paper "Toward Multi-Category Garments Virtual Try-on Method by Coarse to Fine TPS Deformation" <br>

## 
- Our paper has been accepted by NCAA, and it is [available online](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-022-07173-w).

## Requirements
- python3
- numpy
- cv2
- skimage
- matplotlib

## Getting Started

We have provided an example for preparing your dateset.  
You can change coefficients in options.py and run.

``` 
python main.py
```
